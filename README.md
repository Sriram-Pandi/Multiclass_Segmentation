## Project Overview

Multiclass segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, often applied in domains such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imagery. In this project:
- A **U-Net-based model** is trained to perform pixel-wise classification.
- The dataset contains images with multiple classes, each representing a distinct region of interest.
- The training process involves data augmentation, loss optimization, and performance monitoring.

---

## Features

- Implements **U-Net architecture** with custom enhancements.
- Supports multiclass segmentation with pixel-wise classification.
- Includes training and testing pipelines.
- Utilizes **data augmentation** techniques to improve model robustness.
- Provides visualization of segmentation results for evaluation.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`

Install them using:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Usage Instructions

### Training the Model
To train the segmentation model, use the following command:
```bash
python segmentation.py train --dataset <path_to_dataset>
```

### Testing the Model
To test the model on new images:
```bash
python segmentation.py test --image <path_to_image>
```
This will:
- Predict segmentation masks for the input image.
- Save the predicted masks in the `results/` directory for visualization.
